We'd love to hear from you if you like opc-diag, want a new feature, find
a bug, need help using it, or just have a word of encouragement. Here's how:


Mailing List
------------

If you're having trouble installing or using |opcd|, the mailing list is your
best bet. There is a low-volume mailing list for opc-diag at
python-opc@googlegroups.com


Issues
------

If you're confident what you've encountered is a bug, or if there's a feature
you'd like to see added to |opcd|, open a new issue in the **issue tracker**
on github at `python-openxml/opc-diag`_.

It's a good idea to start the conversation around a new feature request on the
mailing list, it's quick to add it to the issue tracker once we've clarified
the best approach and it becomes actionable.
